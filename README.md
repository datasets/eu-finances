# Motivating Questions

* How big is the EU budget and is it "large" (for what it is)? (large relative to what?)
* How easy is it to find out where money is going?
* Where does the money go? Who controls it?
* Where does money come from?
* How much corruption and waste is there? (is expenditure audited against budget?)
* What does the EU Balance Sheet look like?
* What doees the EU P&L look like (profit understood broadly!) - perhaps this does not make sense for Govs and esp the EU (?)

# Background and Overview

You should probably read the [OpenSpending EU section][os-eu] first - the better parts of this will merge into that over time. This is more of a quick brain dump.

## Introduction

EU budgeting can be broken into 2 parts:

1. An overarching seven year plan known as the "Multiannual Financial Framework" - the EU is therefore a maker "7 year plans" in contrast to the the five year plans of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China!
2. Agreeing individual year budgets within that framework

The MFF is a big deal because it does not just determine the specific budget but general priorties, the process by which funds will be allocated and much more.

The MFF does not determine the specific budget for a given year but it does set maximum expenditure levels and sectoral allocations. As explained in this useful [10 things you need to know about the MFF negotiations][10-things]:

[10-things]: http://consilium.europa.eu/special-reports/mff/10-things

> The MFF Regulation lays down the maximum annual amounts - ceilings - which the EU is allowed to spend on different policy areas - headings - over a period of a minimum of five years. It also sets out an overall ceiling for total expenditure.
> 
> The EU budget is agreed in an annual budget procedure within the expenditure limits of the MFF Regulation. Since the MFF ceilings are not expenditure objectives the annual EU budget is usually lower than the expenditure ceilings in the MFF Regulation. The only exception is cohesion policy where the MFF ceiling is actually considered as an expenditure objective. 

Key political elements of the MFF will likely be agreed in early 2013 to allow time to "allow legislative work to be finalised in time for the next MFF, new rules on own resources and new spending programmes to apply from 1 January 2014." 

## Research

Comments: this is a real rabbit warren including everything from dense web pages (often found 10 links down from the start point) to [embedded Prezi's](http://consilium.europa.eu/special-reports/mff/negotiating-box) (really pretty good!). Plus there are *lots* of acronyms, specialist info etc.

### What Documents are available

* Budget (Commision, Parliament, Council)
* Annual financial report (usually at least a year out of date)

### 2011

### 2013 Budget

* [2012-12-12: Commission statement on Budget agreement](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-12-975_en.htm)
  * Summary: it's way too low. Key point is EU budgets are backwards looking (??) and so this is about paying for 2007-2013 budget cycle and therefore for projects are already in progress.
